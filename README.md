Hexagon Battleship by Yisheng Sun & Shixiang Gao

1.	Simple version of battleship game (https://lukerissacher.com/battleships)

Battleship is similar with the classic game Minesweeper. The simple version of it has a n*n square board, there are several numbers of ships on that board (the board cell has no ship is water), but you don’t know where they are. To locate their positions, you have some clues and hints can help you. 

First, you can know what lengths of boats are on the chessboard and how many boats are there for each length. For example, there are one 3-part long ship, two 2-part long ships, and three 1-part long ship showed in the square box.

Secondly, for each row and column, you can get a number which shows how many ship parts are in this row or column. For example, the number “1” circled means in that column there is only one ship part. And the number “3” circled means there are 3 ship parts in that row. 

In addition, there will be some cells randomly chose which directly tell you what in that cell. You can know what it is based on the picture showed such as water, ship head, ship body or only a 1-part ship. For example, you can directly know there is a 1-part long ship in the left down corner of the board.
